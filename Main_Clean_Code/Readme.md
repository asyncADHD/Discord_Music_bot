This is where the working code will be deposited and written clearly, as of now the development area is in the DUMP/Test folder. It has been designed this way as this is a project, I have little to know experience. As of now (5/01/2222) this folder is empty, however, I have successfully gotten the Bot to send and receive instructions to a server.  I have also completed the task of taking a User input and then return a YouTube URL from that User input.
